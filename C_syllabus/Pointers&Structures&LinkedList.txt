1.Pointers save memory space.

2.Execution time with pointers is faster because data are manipulated with the address, that is, direct access to memory location.

3.Memory is accessed efficiently with the pointers.

4.The pointer assigns and releases the memory as well. Hence it can be said the Memory of pointers is dynamically allocated.

5.Pointers are used with data structures. They are useful for representing two-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.


6.An array, of any type, can be accessed with the help of pointers, without considering its subscript range.

7.Pointers are used for file handling.

8.Pointers are used to allocate memory dynamically.
